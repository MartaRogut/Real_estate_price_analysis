# Real Estate Price Analysis – Poland

End-to-end analytical study of the Polish residential real estate market.

The objective of this project is to identify key drivers influencing apartment prices and evaluate their impact using statistical analysis and a linear regression model.
## Business Problem

Real estate pricing depends on multiple structural and locational factors. 

The goal of this analysis is to determine:
- which apartment characteristics significantly influence price,
- which features generate the strongest price premium,
- how accurately price can be predicted using selected variables.

#Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error

sns.set(style="whitegrid")

#Load Data
df = pd.read_csv("sample_data.csv")
df.head()

# Data Cleaning
## Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned by:
- removing duplicates,
- filtering unrealistic prices and sizes,
- handling missing values,
- removing outliers using the IQR method,
- creating price per square meter variable.

## Relationship Between Apartment Size and Price
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.regplot(x="squareMeters", y="price", data=df, scatter_kws={"alpha":0.2})
plt.title("Price vs Size with Trend Line")
plt.show()

## Price vs Number of Rooms
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.barplot(x="rooms", y="price", data=df)
plt.title("Average Price by Number of Rooms")
plt.show()

## Price vs Distance from City Centre

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.regplot(x="centreDistance", y="price", data=df, scatter_kws={"alpha":0.2})
plt.title("Price vs Distance from Centre")
plt.show()

## Impact of Amenities on Price
amenities = ["hasElevator", "hasParkingSpace", "hasSecurity"]

for col in amenities:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
    sns.barplot(x=col, y="price", data=df)
    plt.title(f"Average Price by {col}")
    plt.show()

## Correlation Matrix

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(numeric_only=True), cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")
plt.show()

## Linear Regression Model

features = [
    "squareMeters",
    "rooms",
    "centreDistance",
    "floor",
    "buildYear",
    "hasElevator",
    "hasParkingSpace",
    "hasSecurity"
]

df_model = df.copy()

binary_cols = ["hasElevator", "hasParkingSpace", "hasSecurity"]

for col in binary_cols:
    df_model[col] = df_model[col].map({"yes": 1, "no": 0})

X = df_model[features]
y = df_model["price"]

X = X.dropna()
y = y.loc[X.index]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("R2 score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))

# future importance
coefficients = pd.Series(model.coef_, index=features)
coefficients.sort_values().plot(kind="barh", figsize=(8,6))
plt.title("Feature Impact on Price")
plt.show()

#Actual vs Predict
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, alpha=0.3)
plt.xlabel("Actual Price")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Price")
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted Prices")
plt.show()

## Conclusion

Apartment size remains the primary pricing driver, while amenities such as elevator and security generate a measurable price premium.

The model explains a moderate proportion of price variability, indicating that additional location-specific variables could further improve predictive accuracy.

Overall, residential pricing is determined by a combination of structural features and building standards rather than a single dominant factor.
