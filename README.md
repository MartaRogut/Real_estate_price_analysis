# Real Estate Price Analysis – Poland

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytical study of the Polish residential real estate market.  
The objective was to identify the key drivers influencing apartment prices and quantify their impact using statistical analysis and a predictive model.

The analysis includes:
- data cleaning and preprocessing,
- exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- correlation assessment,
- feature impact evaluation,
- linear regression model for price prediction.

The results provide insights into how property characteristics and amenities influence market valuation.

## Business Problem

Real estate pricing depends on multiple structural and locational factors.  
Understanding which features significantly influence price is critical for:

- property valuation,
- investment decision-making,
- pricing strategy optimization,
- market segmentation analysis.

The goal of this project is to determine which apartment attributes generate the strongest price premium.


## Relationship Between Apartment Size and Price

The analysis shows a clear positive relationship between apartment size and total property price. As square meters increase, the overall price of the apartment rises, which is confirmed by the upward-sloping regression line.

The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.535 indicates a moderate positive relationship. This suggests that apartment size is a significant pricing factor, though it does not fully explain price variability.

The dispersion of observations around the regression line highlights that properties with similar size may differ substantially in price. This implies that additional factors — such as location, building standard, and amenities — also contribute meaningfully to final property valuation.

Overall, apartment size is a key, but not exclusive, determinant of residential real estate pricing.
